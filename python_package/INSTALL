trackcpp Python package
=======================


REQUIREMENTS

- a C++ compiler with C++11 support (tested with GCC 4.8)
- blas
- gsl (GNU Scientific Library)
- SWIG 2 (tested with SWIG 2.0.11)
- Python 3 (tested with Python 3.4) with header files
- Python setuptools (>=16.0)


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Check include and library paths in Makefile. On a Linux system, the default
options should work (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS); if necessary, alter the
paths. An auxiliary script named 'compile' is provided and may be helpful on
Mac OS X.

2. Run 'make all'.

3. Install the package with 'make install'. This will run 'python3 setup.py
install', installing the Python package to a default location. Arguments to
the command can be supplied through the variable SETUPARGS. Alternatively, the
development version can be installed by running 'make develop', which will run
'python3 setup.py develop' instead; arguments can be supplied the same way.
